### About the project 

This repository contains the model codes for the Arabic Sentiment Analysis  2021 KAUST (King Abdullah University of Science and Technology) competition. The competition was to solve the problem of sentiment analysis of Arabic tweets. The biggest challenge that we faced was because the dataset is highly imbalanced where 68% of the Neutral class compared to Positive and Negative classes, where each of them comprised 16% of the data. We used different techniques to tackle the imbalanced dataset, including using the weighted loss function and Weighted Random Sampling. Also, we used MARBERT, a pre-trained BERT, on Arabic tweets. We have noticed in pre-processing that keeping the emoji is important since it improves performance by 5%. We achieved F1 of 77% and placed 16 out of 74 with only 2.9% different from the first place.
